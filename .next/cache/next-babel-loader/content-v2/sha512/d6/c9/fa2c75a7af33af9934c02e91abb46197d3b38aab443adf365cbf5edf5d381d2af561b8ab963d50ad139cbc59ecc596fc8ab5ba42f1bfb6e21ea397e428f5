Over 1 million cases occur annually in India, with many going undiagnosed.\n        EyeSee is a portable visual field testing device using a VR headset. It is a frugal alternative to the Humphrey method of testing, commonly used by ophthalmologists to detect blind spots. When taking the test, the user is presented with flashing dots at various locations in the field of view and responds by giving signals (button clicks) when they see a dot. A DIY test promotes early diagnosis and awareness in remote and rural regions without sophisticated testing labs.\n        Winner at Carl Zeiss Bi-Nation Hackathon 2018 (Manufacturers of Humphrey Apparatus).\n        Innovate for Society Award from Accenture Innovation Challenge 2018.\n        `,\n  url: \"/post/golden-gate\",\n  buttons: [{\n    url: \"https://yourstory.com/2018/10/healthcare-innovator-aayush-wins-accenture-innovation-challenge/#eyesee\",\n    label: \"In The News\"\n  }]\n}, {\n  title: \"snAPI - REST api from JSON\",\n  body: `\n        A backend server that creates dynamic REST API endpoints from JSON input.
